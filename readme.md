- ![SpringBoot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Framework-SpringBoot-green)
- ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Java%208%20or%20higher-yellow)

 ### Installation

To run this application locally, you will need to have Java and MySQL installed on your machine.

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Create a new MySQL database called `blogapp`
- Make sure you have Java JDK above 8 on ur local machine.
- Update the `application.properties` file in the `src/main/resources` directory to include your MySQL username and password
- Run the application using your IDE or by running the command `mvn spring-boot:run` in the project directory
- Access the APIs using any HTTP client such as Postman or Swagger open AI.


### Data flow

> The application is built using the SpringBoot framework and consists of seven layers: DTO, model, controller, service, security, repository and jwt
- **DTO** -The DTO layer consists of classes that are used to transfer data between different layers of the application
- **Controller** - The controller layer handles the HTTP requests, translates the JSON parameter to object, and authenticates the request and transfer it to the business (service) layer.
- **Service** -The business layer handles all the business logic. It consists of service classes and uses services provided by data access layers.
- **Security** -We configure Spring security in this layer by creating security beans such as UserDetailsService,PasswordEncoder,SecurityFilterChain
- **JWT** - In this layer we configure JWT Authentication filter and create Jwt entry point.
- **Repository** - This layer maintains the data by accessing Mysql Database on which CRUD operations are performed.. for that we extend our interface with another interface called JpaRepository.
- **Model** - This layer consists basically the class level things-and this classes are stored in form of tables in given Mysql database as we annotate this class by @Entity.
